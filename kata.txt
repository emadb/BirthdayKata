Problem: write a program that
1.Loads a set of employee records from a flat file
2.Sends a greetings email to all employees whose birthday is today
The flat file is a sequence of records, separated by newlines; this are the first few lines:

last_name, first_name, date_of_birth, email
Doe, John, 1982/10/08, john.doe@foobar.com
Ann, Mary, 1975/09/11, mary.ann@foobar.com
The greetings email contains the following text:

Subject: Happy birthday!

Happy birthday, dear John!
with the first name of the employee substituted for “John”

An optional complication
If you want to develop further the domain logic, you can take into account the special rule for people born on a 29th of February: they should be sent greetings on the 28th of February, except in leap years, when they will get their greetings on the 29th.
